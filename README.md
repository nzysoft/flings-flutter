# Flings - A Things-style todo list app written in Flutter

Hi friends! If you're here, you either got here by accident, or you've come from my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsKzYohhs9FF7Y_81fK-JZQ). Either way, welcome!

Flings is an open-source example project, written in Flutter. The goals of the project are as follows:

1. To provide a high-quality, realistic example of a production-quality Flutter app running on multiple screen sizes and platforms
2. To showcase a "living" project with a transparent, publicly documented development process
3. To learn more about Flutter and other related technologies and packages
4. To have some fun!

This project is **not** intended to become an app that people use in the real world. While the app we'll build is heavily inspired by Cultured Code's [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/), it is in no way intended to compete with it. If you want a todo list app that works like Things, go and buy Things. It's amazing. I won't be releasing Flings on any app stores, although you can of course download the source code and compile it yourself if you must.

## Why copy Things?

1. The underlying business logic in Things is pretty transparent. It will be easy to establish requirements for each feature without having to dig too deep
2. There's a clear path from "as simple as possible" to "having all of the features", making it perfect for an agile, iterative approach
3. It's offline-first, which is really attractive to me because it's a new challenge, and I'm not sure many example apps implement offline-first
4. It's beautiful, and I think it will stretch my ability to build pretty animations and things like that

## Following along

Any development will be filmed and released on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsKzYohhs9FF7Y_81fK-JZQ). The repository contains tags which correspond to videos, so it should be easy to checkout the code at every stage of the development process. All development will take place on the `master` branch.

## Development Process

I won't be attempting to replicate the entire Things 3 experience in one shot. I'll start with the simplest possible functionality and iterate from there. Agile and all that.

I'll be attempting to create the highest-quality codebase I can; this is about best practices after all. To that end, I'm going to be linting the project using the [`effective_dart`](https://pub.dev/packages/effective_dart) package, and I'll be aiming for the highest possible test coverage.

## Contributing

Because this project is about providing an example, and documenting the development process, I won't be allowing other contributions. Sorry.
